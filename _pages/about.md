I am a finishing Ph.D. candidate at the [Institute of Economic Studies](https://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/en), Charles University. My main research focus spans topics in empirical asset pricing and financial econometrics. I am especially interested in how investors price asymmetric and tail risk in the cross-section of asset returns. Moreover, I combine this stream of literature with literature that investigates the pricing of exposures to common factors.

My research was published in the *Journal of Financial Econometrics* (see [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/jjfinec/nbac017)) and is in the Revise & Resubmit stage in the *Review of Finance* (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14267)).

I am in the 2023/24 **job market**. You can find my job market paper here.
