I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Finance at the [University of Liverpool Management School](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/management/). I hold a Ph.D. in Finance and Economics from the [Institute of Economic Studies](https://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/en), Charles University.

My main research focus spans topics in empirical asset pricing and financial econometrics. I am especially interested in how investors price asymmetric and tail risk in the cross-section of asset returns. Moreover, I combine this stream of literature with literature that investigates the pricing of exposures to common factors.

My research was published in the *Journal of Financial Econometrics* (see [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/jjfinec/nbac017)) and is in the Revise & Resubmit stage in the *Review of Finance* (see [here](/files/common_idio_quant_revised.pdf)).
